I began this assignment by trying to create a superhero and a supervillain. The goal was for the superhero to stop the villains by collinding with them. I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do with my collision animation, so he just stretches out long when he collides with the villain.

In this assignment I stuck strictly to the instruction and just added code that made the villain, now coin, spawn in another random location when the superhero collided with him.

In this assignment I added a counter that would display in the top right corner. Once the superhero collects 5 coins, as shown in the display, the game will end.
